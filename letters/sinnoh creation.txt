In swirling chaos, a void so vast,
An egg emerged, a primal task.
From this egg, a being of light,
Arceus arose, with power and might.

With a whisper of time, Dialga was born,
Controlling the hours, till night and morn.
In the realm of space, Palkia took flight,
Shaping dimensions, with strength and might.

Uxie, Mesprit, Azelf so bright,
The Lake Guardians, with wisdom and light.
Knowledge, emotion, willpower they weave,
Into the fabric of life, they conceive.

But Giratina, from shadows deep,
A distorted reflection, a secret to keep.
In the Distortion World, it dwells alone,
Balancing creation, on its twisted throne.
