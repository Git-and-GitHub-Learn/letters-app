To the Students of Shujin Academy,

It is with deep regret that I address you today regarding the recent arrest of Suguru Kamoshida,
our former volleyball coach. The charges against him are grave and deeply disturbing. 
The school administration has been cooperating fully with the authorities and will
continue to do so throughout the investigation. 

The safety and well-being of our students are of paramount importance.
We are shocked and saddened that such events could occur within our school community.
We acknowledge that trust has been broken, and we are committed to taking all necessary
measures to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future.

We understand that this news may be upsetting for many of you, and we encourage anyone who has been affected
to reach out to our counseling services for support.
We will continue to update the school community as new information becomes available.
We thank you for your patience and understanding during this difficult time. 

Sincerely,

Makoto Niijima
Student Council President
Shujin Academy
